This was a first attempt (with AI carrying most of the load) to create a shared program for an engineering team to compile quotes from outside vendors on piece parts. I learned a lot of how to prompt AI, explaining exactly what I wanted the fuctions to do, and tried to keep everything as clean as possible. I started this with zero knowledge of how to code, what programs to use, or what language to even do it in. 

This was my beginning into creating software and beginning to understand what basic code was doing. I would like to eventually rebuild this application when I acquire better skills. This will remain untouched to show where I began.
